Dedicated my life to Software Engineering and Tech-Related Developments for the greater good.<br>
Yet, I still have a lot to learn.<br>

Currently a Software Engineer at Unit4 (International Company)<br>
Former Software Engineer at Shopee (International), and tiket.com (Multi-National)<br>
Former CTO and Co-Founder of INSPIX Technologies, and Silhouette Studios Startup.

In other areas than Software Engineering, I am very fascinated with History, Astronomy, and Arts. Perhaps if you have an open-source project that combines Software Engineering with these areas and in a need of my help, do let me know!

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have something to discuss!<br>
I humbly give you many thanks for visiting my profile!
